This model was contributed by A Salimi-Badr.
<p/>
It is a model of solving inverse kinematics (IK) based on Basal Ganglia (BG)
<p/>It was originally simulated in Matlab 2014 and has been found to also work in Matlab 2017b.
<p/><ol>To run the simulation:
	<li>- Run parameters.m
	</li><li>- Run BG.slx (after typing BG on the matlab command line once the below window loads select Simulation -> Run from the simulink menus:
	<img src="./screenshot1.png" alt="screenshot1" width="550">
	</li><li>After running you will see a graph like the below and files will be written to the top level folder:<p/>
	<img src="./screenshot2.png" alt="screenshot2" width="550">
	</li><li>- After simulation, to see the movement run animation.m
</li></ol>
<p/>
<ol>To simulate the Parkinsonian condition:
	<li>- set g = 0.1 in parameters.m
	</li><li>- set tau = 0.050 in parameters.m
</ol><p/>
<ol>To show the circular movement:
	<li>- Replace Reaching block with Circular block
